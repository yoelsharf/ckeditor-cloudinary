CKEditor 4: upload images to Cloudinary

This is a straightforward and working example of CKEditor integration with Cloudinary.

The purpose of this code is to enable end users to upload images using CKEditor 4 Image Upload Plugin directly from their browser to Cloudinary servers. (without going through your web server)

To use it, All you need is to fill in the two constants at lines 20-21:
    const cloudName = '<Your cloudName>';
		const unsignedUploadPreset = '<Your unsignedUploadPreset>';
 You can get those at Cloudinary admin interface.
  
  Good luck!
